# Avro Ts CLI

CLI tool to convert avro schemas (avsc files) into typescript types, using [@ovotech/avro-ts](../avro-ts)

## Using with CLI

```bash
yarn add @ovotech/avro-ts-cli
yarn avro-ts convert avro/*.avsc --output-dir __generated__/
```

If no output dir is provided, the avsc files will be generated alongside the source files

```bash
yarn avro-ts convert avro/*.avsc
```

Logical types are also supported:

```bash
yarn avro-ts convert avro/*.avsc --logical-type date=string --logical-type timestamp-millis=string
```

And custom imports:

```bash
yarn avro-ts convert avro/*.avsc --logical-type date=Decimal --logical-type-import "Decimal='import { Decimal } from 'my-library'"
```

## Running the tests

You can run the tests with:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Coding style (linting, etc) tests

Style is maintained with prettier and tslint

```
yarn lint
```

## Deployment

Deployment is preferment by lerna automatically on merge / push to master, but you'll need to bump the package version numbers yourself. Only updated packages with newer versions will be pushed to the npm registry.
