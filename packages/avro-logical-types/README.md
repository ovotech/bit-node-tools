### Using

```bash
yarn add @ovotech/avro-logical-types
```

```typescript
import { DateType } from '@ovotech/avro-logical-types';
import { Type } from 'avsc';

const type = Type.forSchema(
  {
    type: 'record',
    fields: [{ name: 'kind', type: { type: 'enum', symbols: ['CAT', 'DOG'] } }, { name: 'name', type: 'string' }],
  },
  { logicalTypes: { date: DateType } },
);
```

Or with [@ovotech/avro-stream](https://github.com/ovotech/bit-node-tools/tree/master/packages/avro-stream)

```typescript
import { AvroDeserializer } from '@ovotech/avro-stream';
import { DateType, TimestampType } from '@ovotech/avro-logical-types';

const deserializer = new AvroDeserializer('http://localhost:8081', {
  logicalTypes: { date: DateType, 'timestamp-millis': TimestampType },
});
```
